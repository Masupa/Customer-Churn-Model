### Project Context


In the competitive world of business, customer retention is key. It keeps businesses running and successful, and it costs fractions far less than the cost of acquiring new customers. Therefore, it is important for businesses to analyze this metric and finds ways to maximise it.

To measure and maximise customer retention, companies need to keep track of customer churn with the aim to minimize it. In simple terms, customer churn is the percentage of customer that stopped using a company’s product and services within a certain time-frame. This percentage is one of the most important metrics for a business to evaluate as it gives a hard truth about the retention of customers.

For example, if a company starts a quarter with 500 customers and ends with 400, that company’s customer churn is 20% because it lost 20% of its customers. At the same time, Its customer retention is 80% because it retained 80% of its customers.

In this project, I will be exploring customer churn in the telecommunication sector. The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly.
